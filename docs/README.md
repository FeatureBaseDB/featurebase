Pilosa docs are maintained here, to stay in sync with the codebase. The format is [Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) markdown, with some Hugo [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

Please visit [our website](https://www.pilosa.com/docs/) to view the docs complete with styles, diagrams, and comprehensive search. Internal links will only work on the website.

Have you found a discrepancy, typo, or other problem? Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/pilosa/pilosa/issues/new) or a pull request!
