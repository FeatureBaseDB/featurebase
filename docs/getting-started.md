## Getting Started

Pilosa supports an HTTP interface which uses JSON by default.
Any HTTP tool can be used to interact with the Pilosa server. The examples in this documentation will use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) which is available by default on many UNIX-like systems including Linux and MacOS. Windows users can download curl [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

<div class="note">
    <p>Note that Pilosa server requires a high limit for open files. Check the documentation of your system to see how to increase it in case you hit that limit. See <a href="/docs/administration/#open-file-limits">Open File Limits</a> for more details.</p>
</div>

### Starting Pilosa

Follow the steps in the [Install]({{< ref "installation.md" >}}) document to install Pilosa.
Execute the following in a terminal to run Pilosa with the default configuration (Pilosa will be available at `localhost:10101`):
```
pilosa server
```
If you are using the Docker image, you can run an ephemeral Pilosa container on the default address using the following command:
```
docker run -it --rm --name pilosa -p 10101:10101 pilosa/pilosa:latest
```

Let's make sure Pilosa is running:
```
curl localhost:10101/status
```

Which should output: `{"status":{"Nodes":[{"Host":":10101","State":"UP"}]}}`

### Sample Project

In order to better understand Pilosa's capabilities, we will create a sample project called "Star Trace" containing information about the top 1,000 most recently updated Github repositories which have "go" in their name. The Star Trace index will include data points such as programming language, tags, and stargazersâ€”people who have starred a project.

Although Pilosa doesn't keep the data in a tabular format, we still use the terms "columns" and "rows" when describing the data model. We put the primary objects in columns, and the properties of those objects in rows. For example, the Star Trace project will contain an index called "repository" which contains columns representing Github repositories, and rows representing properties like programming languages and tags. We can better organize the rows by grouping them into sets called Frames. So the "repository" index might have a "languages" frame as well as a "tags" frame. You can learn more about indexes and frames in the [Data Model](../data-model) section of the documentation.

#### Create the Schema

Note:
The queries in this section which are used to set up the indexes in Pilosa just the empty object on success: `{}` - if you would like to verify that a query worked as you expected, you can request the schema as follows:
```
curl localhost:10101/schema
{"indexes":null}
```

Before we can import data or run queries, we need to create our indexes and the frames within them. Let's create the repository index first:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository -X POST
```

Let's create the `stargazer` frame which has user IDs of stargazers as its rows:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/frame/stargazer -X POST
```

Next up is the `language` frame, which will contain IDs for programming languages:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/frame/language -X POST
```

#### Import Data From CSV Files

If you import data using csv files and without input defintion, download the `stargazer.csv` and `language.csv` files in that repo.

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pilosa/getting-started/master/stargazer.csv
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pilosa/getting-started/master/language.csv
```

Run the following commands to import the data into Pilosa:

```
pilosa import -i repository -f stargazer stargazer.csv
pilosa import -i repository -f language language.csv
```

If you are using a Docker container for Pilosa (with name `pilosa`), you should instead copy the `*.csv` file into the container and then import them:
```
docker cp stargazer.csv pilosa:/stargazer.csv
docker exec -it pilosa /pilosa import -i repository -f stargazer /stargazer.csv
docker cp language.csv pilosa:/language.csv
docker exec -it pilosa /pilosa import -i repository -f language /language.csv
```

Note that, both the user IDs and the repository IDs were remapped to sequential integers in the data files, they don't correspond to actual Github IDs anymore. You can check out `languages.txt` to see the mapping for languages.

### Input Definition
Alternatively Pilosa can import JSON data using an [Input Definition](../input-definition/) describing the schema and ETL rules to process the data.  

#### Make Some Queries

<div class="note">
    <p>Note the Pilosa server comes with a <a href="../webui/">WebUI</a> for constructing queries in a browser. In local development, it is available at <a href="http://localhost:10101">localhost:10101</a>.</p>
</div>

Which repositories did user 14 star:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=14)'
```

What are the top 5 languages in the sample data:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'TopN(frame="language", n=5)'
```

Which repositories were starred by user 14 and 19:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Intersect(Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=14), Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=19))'
```

Which repositories were starred by user 14 or 19:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Union(Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=14), Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=19))'
```

Which repositories were starred by user 14 and 19 and also were written in language 1:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Intersect(Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=14), Bitmap(frame="stargazer", rowID=19), Bitmap(frame="language", rowID=1))'
```

Set user 99999 as a stargazer for repository 77777:
```
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'SetBit(frame="stargazer", columnID=77777, rowID=99999)'
```

### What's Next?
