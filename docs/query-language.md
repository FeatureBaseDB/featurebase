## Query Language

### Overview

This section will provide a detailed reference and examples for the Pilosa Query Language (PQL). All PQL queries operate on a single [index](../glossary/#index) and are passed to Pilosa through the `/index/INDEX_NAME/query` endpoint. You may pass multiple PQL queries in a single request by simply concatenating the queries together - a space is not needed. The results format is always:

```
{"results":[...]}
```

There will be one item in the `results` array for each PQL query in the request. The type of each item in the array will depend on the type of query - each query in the reference below lists its result type.

#### Conventions

* Angle Brackets `<>` denote required arguments
* Square Brackets `[]` denote optional arguments
* UPPER_CASE denotes a descriptor that will need to be filled in with a concrete value (e.g. `ATTR_NAME`, `STRING`)

##### Examples

Before running any of the example queries below, follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) section to set up an index and fields, and to populate them with some data.

The examples just show the PQL quer(ies) needed - to run the query `Set(10, stargazer=1)` against a server using curl, you would:
``` request
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query \
     -X POST \
     -d 'Set(10, stargazer=1)'
```
``` response
{"results":[true]}
```

#### Arguments and Types

* `field` The field specifies on which Pilosa [field](../glossary/#field) the query will operate. Valid field names are lower case strings; they start with an alphanumeric character, and contain only alphanumeric characters and `_-`. They must be 64 characters or less in length.
* `TIMESTAMP` This is a timestamp in the following format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` (e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04)
* `UINT` An unsigned integer (e.g. 42839)
* `ATTR_NAME` Must be a valid identifier `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`
* `ATTR_VALUE` Can be a string, float, integer, or bool.
* `ROW_CALL` Any query which returns a row, such as `Row`, `Union`, `Difference`, `Xor`, `Intersect`, `Range`
* `[]ATTR_VALUE` Denotes an array of `ATTR_VALUE`s. (e.g. `["a", "b", "c"]`)

### Write Operations

#### Set

**Spec:**

```
Set(<COLUMN>, <FIELD>=<ROW>, [TIMESTAMP])
```

**Description:**

`Set` assigns a value of 1 to a bit in the binary matrix, thus associating the given row (the `<ROW>` value) in the given field with the given column.

**Result Type:** boolean

A return value of `true` indicates that the bit was changed to 1.

A return value of `false` indicates that the bit was already set to 1 and nothing changed.


**Examples:**

Set the bit at row 1, column 10:
```request
Set(10, stargazer=1)
```
```response
{"results":[true]}
```

This sets a bit in the stargazer field, representing that the user with id=1 has starred the repository with id=10.

Set also supports providing a timestamp. To write the date that a user starred a repository:
```request
Set(10, stargazer=1, 2016-01-01T00:00)
```
```response
{"results":[true]}
```

Set multiple bits in a single request:
```request
Set(1, stargazer=10) Set(2, stargazer=10) Set(1, stargazer=20) Set(2, stargazer=30)
```
```response
{"results":[false,true,true,true]}
```

Set the field "pullrequests" to integer value 2 at column 10:
```request
Set(10, pullrequests=2)
```
```response
{"results":[true]}
```

#### SetRowAttrs
**Spec:**

```
SetRowAttrs(<FIELD>, <ROW>, 
            <ATTR_NAME=ATTR_VALUE>, 
            [ATTR_NAME=ATTR_VALUE ...])
```

**Description:**

`SetRowAttrs` associates arbitrary key/value pairs with a row in a field. Setting a value of `null`, without quotes, deletes an attribute.

**Result Type:** null

SetRowAttrs queries always return `null` upon success.

**Examples:**

Set attributes `username` and `active` on row 10:
```request
SetRowAttrs(stargazer, 10, username="mrpi", active=true)
```
```response
{"results":[null]}
```

Set username value and active status for user 10. These are arbitrary key/value pairs which have no meaning to Pilosa. You can see the attributes you've set on a row with a [Row](../query-language/#row) query like so `Row(stargazer=10)`.

Delete attribute `username` on row 10:
```request
SetRowAttrs(stargazer, 10, username=null)
```
```response
{"results":[null]}
```

#### SetColumnAttrs

**Spec:**

```
SetColumnAttrs(<COLUMN>, 
               <ATTR_NAME=ATTR_VALUE>, 
               [ATTR_NAME=ATTR_VALUE ...])
```

**Description:**

`SetColumnAttrs` associates arbitrary key/value pairs with a column in an index.

**Result Type:** null

SetColumnAttrs queries always return `null` upon success. Setting a value of `null`, without quotes, deletes an attribute.

**Examples:**

Set attributes `stars`, `url`, and `active` on column 10:
```request
SetColumnAttrs(10, stars=123, url="http://projects.pilosa.com/10", active=true)
```
```response
{"results":[null]}
```

Set url value and active status for project 10. These are arbitrary key/value pairs which have no meaning to Pilosa.

ColumnAttrs can be requested by adding the URL parameter `columnAttrs=true` to a query. For example:
```request
curl localhost:10101/index/repository/query?columnAttrs=true -XPOST -d 'Row(stargazer=1) Row(stargazer=2)'
```
```response
{
  "results":[
    {"attrs":{},"cols":[10,20]},
    {"attrs":{},"cols":[10,30]}
  ],
  "columnAttrs":[
    {"id":10,"attrs":{"active":true,"stars":123,"url":"http://projects.pilosa.com/10"}},
    {"id":20,"attrs":{"active":false,"stars":456,"url":"http://projects.pilosa.com/30"}}
  ]
}
```

In this example, ColumnAttrs have been set on columns 10 and 20, but not column 30. The relevant attributes are all returned in a single columnAttrs list. See the [query index](../api-reference/#query-index) section for more information.

Delete the `url` attribute on column 10:
```request
SetColumnAttrs(10, url=null)
```
```response
{"results":[null]}
```

#### Clear

**Spec:**

```
Clear(<COLUMN>, <FIELD>=<ROW>)
```

**Description:**

`Clear` assigns a value of 0 to a bit in the binary matrix, thus disassociating the given row in the given field from the given column.

Note that clearing a column on a time field will remove all data for that column.

**Result Type:** boolean

A return value of `true` indicates that the bit was toggled from 1 to 0.

A return value of `false` indicates that the bit was already set to 0 and nothing changed.

**Examples:**

Clear the bit at row 1 and column 10 in the stargazer field:
```request
Clear(10, stargazer=1)
```
```response
{"results":[true]}
```

This represents removing the relationship between the user with id=1 and the repository with id=10.

### Read Operations

#### Row

**Spec:**

```
Row(<FIELD>=<ROW>)
```

**Description:**

`Row` retrieves the indices of all the columns in a row. It also retrieves any attributes set on that row.

**Result Type:** object with attrs and columns.

e.g. `{"attrs":{"username":"mrpi","active":true},"columns":[10, 20]}`

**Examples:**

Query all columns with a bit set in row 1 of the field `stargazer` (repositories that are starred by user 1):
```request
Row(stargazer=1)
```
```response
{"attrs":{"username":"mrpi","active":true},"columns":[10, 20]}
```

* attrs are the attributes for user 1 
* columns are the repositories which user 1 has starred.

#### Union

**Spec:**

```
Union([ROW_CALL ...])
```

**Description:**

Union performs a logical OR on the results of all `ROW_CALL` queries passed to it.

**Result Type:** object with attrs and bits

attrs will always be empty

**Examples:**

Query columns with a bit set in either of two rows (repositories that are starred by either of two users):
```request
Union(Row(stargazer=1), Row(stargazer=2))
```
```response
{"attrs":{},"columns":[10, 20, 30]}
```

* columns are repositories that were starred by user 1 OR user 2

#### Intersect

**Spec:**

```
Intersect(<ROW_CALL>, [ROW_CALL ...])
```

**Description:**

Intersect performs a logical AND on the results of all `ROW_CALL` queries passed to it.

**Result Type:** object with attrs and columns

attrs will always be empty

**Examples:**

Query columns with a bit set in both of two rows (repositories that are starred by both of two users):

```request
Intersect(Row(stargazer=1), Row(stargazer=2))
```
```response
{"attrs":{},"columns":[10]}
```

* columns are repositories that were starred by user 1 AND user 2

#### Difference

**Spec:**

```
Difference(<ROW_CALL>, [ROW_CALL ...])
```

**Description:**

Difference returns all of the bits from the first `ROW_CALL` argument passed to it, without the bits from each subsequent `ROW_CALL`.

**Result Type:** object with attrs and columns

attrs will always be empty

**Examples:**

Query columns with a bit set in one row and not another (repositories that are starred by one user and not another):
```request
Difference(Row(stargazer=1), Row(stargazer=2))
```
```response
{"results":[{"attrs":{},"columns":[20]}]}
```

* columns are repositories that were starred by user 1 BUT NOT user 2

Query for the opposite difference:
```request
Difference(Row(stargazer=2), Row(stargazer=1))
```
```response
{"attrs":{},"columns":[30]}
```

* columnss are repositories that were starred by user 2 BUT NOT user 1

#### Xor

**Spec:**

```
Xor(<ROW_CALL>, [ROW_CALL ...])
```

**Description:**

Xor performs a logical XOR on the results of each `ROW_CALL` query passed to it.

**Result Type:** object with attrs and columns

attrs will always be empty

**Examples:**

Query columns with a bit set in exactly one of two rows (repositories that are starred by only one of two users):

```request
Xor(Row(stargazer=2), Row(stargazer=1))
```
```response
{"results":[{"attrs":{},"columns":[10,20,30]}]}
```

* columns are repositories that were starred by user 1 XOR user 2 (user 1 or user 2, but not both)

#### Count
**Spec:**

```
Count(<ROW_CALL>)
```

**Description:**

Returns the number of set bits in the `ROW_CALL` passed in.

**Result Type:** int

**Examples:**

Query the number of bits set in a row (the number of repositories a user has starred):
```request
Count(Row(stargazer=1))
```
```response
{"results":[1]}
```

* Result is the number of repositories that user 1 has starred.

#### TopN

**Spec:**

```
TopN(<FIELD>, [ROW_CALL], [n=UINT],
     [attrName=<ATTR_NAME>, attrValues=<[]ATTR_VALUE>])
```

**Description:**

Return the id and count of the top `n` rows (by count of bits) in the field.
The `attrName` and `attrValues` arguments work together to only return rows which
have the attribute specified by `attrName` with one of the values specified in
`attrValues`.

**Result Type:** array of key/count objects

**Caveats:**

* Performing a TopN() query on a field with cache type ranked will return the top rows sorted by count in descending order.
* Fields with cache type lru will maintain an LRU (Least Recently Used replacement policy) cache, thus a TopN query on this type of field will return rows sorted in order of most recently set bit.
* The field's cache size determines the number of sorted rows to maintain in the cache for purposes of TopN queries. There is a tradeoff between performance and accuracy; increasing the cache size will improve accuracy of results at the cost of performance.
* Once full, the cache will truncate the set of rows according to the field option CacheSize. Rows that straddle the limit and have the same count will be truncated in no particular order.
* The TopN query's attribute filter is applied to the existing sorted cache of rows. Rows that fall outside of the sorted cache range, even if they would normally pass the filter, are ignored.

See [field creation](../api-reference/#create-field) for more information about the cache.

**Examples:**

Basic TopN query:
```request
TopN(stargazer)
```
```response
{"results":[[{"id":1240,"count":102},{"id":4734,"count":100},{"id":12709,"count":93},...]]}
```

* `id` is a row ID (user ID)
* `count` is a count of columns (repositories)
* Results are the number of bits set in the corresponding row (repositories that each user starred) in descending order for all rows (users) in the stargazer field. For example user 1240 starred 102 repositories, user 4734 starred 100 repositories, user 12709 starred 93 repository.

Limit the number of results:
```request
TopN(stargazer, n=2)
```
```response
{"results":[[{"id":1240,"count":102},{"id":4734,"count":100}]]}
```

* Results are the top two rows (users) sorted by number of bits set (repositories they've starred) in descending order.

Filter based on an existing row:
```request
TopN(stargazer, Row(language=1), n=2)
```
```response
{"results":[[{"id":1240,"count":35},{"id":7508,"count":32}]]}
```

* Results are the top two users (rows) sorted by the number of bits set in the intersection with row 1 of the language field (repositories that they've starred which are written in language 1).

Filter based on attributes:
```request
TopN(stargazer, n=2, attrName=active, attrValues=[true])
```
```response
{"results":[[{"id":10,"count":1},{"id":13,"count":1}]]}
```

* Results are the top two users (rows) which have the "active" attribute set to "true", sorted by the number of bits set (repositories that they've starred).

#### Range Queries

**Spec:**

```
Range(<FIELD>=<ROW>, <TIMESTAMP>, <TIMESTAMP>)
```

**Description:**

Similar to `Row`, but only returns bits which were set with timestamps
between the given `start` (first) and `end` (second) timestamps. 

**Result Type:** object with attrs and bits


**Examples:**

Query all columns with a bit set in row 1 of a field (repositories that a user has starred), within a date range:
```request
Range(stargazer=1, 2010-01-01T00:00, 2017-03-02T03:00)
```
```response
{{"attrs":{},"columns":[10]}
```

This example assumes timestamps have been set on some bits.

* columns are repositories which were starred by user 1 in the time range 2010-01-01 to 2017-03-02.


#### Range (BSI)

**Spec:**

```
Range([<COMPARISON_VALUE> <COMPARISON_OPERATOR>] <FIELD> <COMPARISON_OPERATOR> <COMPARISON_VALUE>)
```

**Description:**

The `Range` query is overloaded to work on `integer` values as well as `timestamp` values.
Returns bits that are true for the comparison operator.

**Result Type:** object with attrs and columns

**Examples:**

In our source data, commitactivity was counted over the last year.
The following greater-than `Range` query returns all columns with a field value greater than 100 (repositories having more than 100 commits):

```request
Range(commitactivity > 100)
```
```response
{{"attrs":{},"columns":[10]}
```

* columns are repositories which had at least 100 commits in the last year.

BSI range queries support the following operators:

 Operator | Name                          | Value              
----------|-------------------------------|--------------------
 `>`      | greater-than, GT              | integer            
 `<`      | less-than, LT                 | integer            
 `<=`     | less-than-or-equal-to, LTE    | integer            
 `>=`     | greater-than-or-equal-to, GTE | integer            
 `==`     | equal-to, EQ                  | integer            
 `!=`     | not-equal-to, NEQ             | integer or `null`  

`<`, and `<=` can be chained together to represent a bounded interval. For example:

```request
Range(50 < commitactivity < 150)
```
```response
{{"attrs":{},"columns":[10]}
```

As of Pilosa 1.0, the "between" syntax `Range(frame=stats, commitactivity >< [50, 150])` is no longer supported.

#### Min

**Spec:**

```
Min([ROW_CALL], field=<FIELD>)
```

**Description:**

Returns the minimum value of all BSI integer values in this `field`. If the optional `Row` call is supplied, only columns with set bits are considered, otherwise all columns are considered.

**Result Type:** object with the min and count of columns containing the min value.

**Examples:**

Query the minimum value of a field (minimum size of all repositories):
```request
Min(field="diskusage")
```
```response
{"value":4,"count":2}
```

* Result is the smallest value (repository size in kilobytes, here), plus the count of columns with that value.

#### Max

**Spec:**

```
Max([ROW_CALL], field=<FIELD>)
```

**Description:**

Returns the maximum value of all BSI integer values in this `field`. If the optional `Row` call is supplied, only columns with set bits are considered, otherwise all columns are considered.

**Result Type:** object with the max and count of columns containing the max value.

**Examples:**

Query the maximum value of a field (maximum size of all repositories):
```request
Max(field="diskusage")
```
```response
{"value":88,"count":13}
```

* Result is the largest value (repository size in kilobytes, here), plus the count of columns with that value.

#### Sum

**Spec:**

```
Sum([ROW_CALL], field=<FIELD>)
```

**Description:**

Returns the count and computed sum of all BSI integer values in the `field`. If the optional `Row` call is supplied, columns with set bits are summed, otherwise the sum is across all columns.

**Result Type:** object with the computed sum and count of the values in the integer field.

**Examples:**

Query the size of all repositories.
```request
Sum(field="diskusage")
```
```response
{"value":10,"count":3}
```

* Result is the sum of all values (total size of all repositories in kilobytes, here), plus the count of columns.
