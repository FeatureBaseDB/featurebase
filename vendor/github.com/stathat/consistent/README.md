consistent
==========

Consistent hash package for Go.

Installation
------------

    go get github.com/stathat/consistent

Examples
--------

Look at the godoc.

Status
------

This package was extracted from production code powering [StatHat](http://www.stathat.com),
so clearly we feel that it is production-ready, but it should still be considered
experimental as other uses of it could reveal issues we aren't experiencing.
