adding a test case to the bug repros directory??? no problem!!! its a snap!!!

just make a shell script that does the test you want and name it some thing like:

fb42069-test.sh

this will get picked up by run-all.sh and get run automatically!!!


# THINGS TO NOTE
- the datanode0 ip will be passed to your script in $1 via qa/scripts/bug_repro_tests.sh

# ENTHUSIASM
WOW

shout out to computers for making our lives easier! :) üëç
